    <h1>History of Hydrona</h1>
    <p>Our Collective archives have curated over 50,000 collective works including art, old technology and memories collected by The Hydrona Collective Experience System. If a compatible and a hydrona share a collective experience similar to a memory stored within the hydra device, the device will automatically share the memories between them both. So far over 16,000 seperate archives have been collected. These archives are avalible for viewing at The Vault of Miracles.</p>
    <p>If you find any old articales, journals or other items of the like they are to be turned into PO Box 45 at Hyperion Industries. </p>

    <p>In ancient times that were recorded, there were 5 Royals, Two Kings, Two Queens 
      and A non gender conforming leader, they each commanded a specific band of galaxies.
       They were Revarik, Kolbic, Wendira, Pandra and Finnick.
        Revarik discovered a stone at the edge of his band and created 
        The first Hydra device, sharing the knowlege with his peers. 
        Soon all soldiers were issued this device as it activated magic within thier souls, 
        thier abillity to merge. During Testing of the devices potential, Wendira's Husband,
        Lenook, went insane and died shortly after. These devices caused devastation 
        when Wendira in her grief of her husband, declared war on Revarik.
         All soildiers followed the same ill fate of Wendira's husband, 
         turning into horrid beast that ate flesh of those were once like minded inviduals 
         and with this crisis the war ended. Revarik's solution was to simply learn to 
         control them, he took volenteers and began expirementation. 
         Due to a lack in subjects to test, he eventully turned himself 
         and used the cure he developed which only drove him to become a sociopath that
          desired nothing but revenge and blood.
           Since all Hydra's were taken and then destroyed after the war 
           all except the orginal which held great historical value, 
           Revarik fought for his orginal device back, but was denied by the other
            four rulers. He soon amased an army of clones and horribly 
            bioengeneered beasts from universes within his quadrant. 
            Soon war was declared. The Four ruers made a deal with a traveller,
             to carry the device far away, in hopes no one would use it again.
      he buried it within the Sands of pandora, 
      which was found 100,000 years later by a group of friends, 
      one of them was Sarah Lynx, the last surviving human with the Hydronic Gene, 
      which allowed use of the Hydra. When a Hydra user dies, 
      they can Transfer the piece of thier soul containing the gene to whoever they wish, 
      but in concequence, can only move on to the afterlife when the Soulborne dies. 
      There is a Prohecy within cortaxia to the Final User. 
  <p>"Final Blood User, Beast of Red, Your fate is cruel and your life shall be filled with unrest,</p>
  <p>To your chosen soul, we gift the abillity to end all worlds and restart all worlds, to make everything as if it were fiction,</p>
  <p>To achive this there is but 9 you must seek,</p>

  <p>The Messenger, An old friend trapped with those who despise all he his.</p>
  <p>A cold heart, fearful of closed spaces and a mind spoken loud and broken,</p>
  <p>A Thorn in all sides, wild at heart, and a face of fangs,</p>
  <p>A Flame Caster, with once burning desires left behind,</p>
  <p>The Nowhere king, Who accepts no judgement, till his hour before crowning,</p>
  <p>A Tratior, who's wings shine of remorse and hatred.</p>
  <p>A King, who's throne is as broken as the castle he sits within.</p>
  <p>A Girl in chains, a prison built on her mind scattered and memories of ash.</p>

  <p>These are the one's who bring about the end in reverse order, the final crime our race is to commit before it becomes but a memory to the soulborne and in them alone we confide when the first universe dies"</p>
  <p>-King Kolbic of Hydronac Band 3</p>

  <h2>Myths and Legends</h2>
  <p>Thanks to Cortaxia, Our organization has been able to locate and piece together ancient Hydrona 
    myths and legends.</p>
  <p>Myth of Kolbic's Tree: Kolbic was well known among the Hydronic Royals for his high value for life.
     In his grief of his wife he had grown an obsession and affinity for plants.
    He valued all life, every flower, every leaf every weed to him they held purpose.
     It was the thing he loved most aside from the late queen.
     One day he entered his greenroom to find the smallest tree, a pine of sorts, small and fleeting, 
     planted at it's centre. It appeared as if it had been growing for at least a decade despite never 
     being there before. There was no information regarding it, but he tried his best to keep it alive.
      It withered away despite constant attention and care much to his frustration. 
     During the war, he was said to had died in greenroom, his husk, laying on the tree. 
     The soldier who had killed him had witnessed a miracale of gods. The tree had grown to it's full size,
      a beatiful rainbow of leaves glowed and created a canopy within the room. The corpse that had lay in the room became one with the tree, a single branch extended from the tree pointed at the soldier, accusitory.
    To his suprise, it spoke. "You, You did this to me. You killed two living things and intend to kill more, your fate is sealed, may the gods be against you,"
  To the soldiers fears he'd been betrayed, moments later by his fellow assasin, who afterwards was killed by the tree.
Since then, the tree is said to be a bad omen, it grew with death, despite being already dead. The Greenhouse itself, has vanished, as if it had never existed, waiting for the final user to find it.</p>
<p>Myth of Heracon and the Rilcorn: Heracon was a writer of stories within Cortaxia, safe from war. Within the walls she grew increasingly restless.
   Her writings worried Finnick, who had long noticed her intesnse insomnia and they decided to give her a mission and a lesson. 
   They had assigned her to search a universe he had chosen beforehand for a specific creature and asked her to study it and report her findings back to them. 
   The creature the leader had chosen, "simply didn't exist" It did and Finnik knew that Heracon would stop at nothing to prove it's existance as she was quite stubborn and desired fame.
  The writer sat where it would reside for days on end, writing her uneasiness as she went. She slowly lost hope as her supplis dwindled, and during a bad storm a group of them revealed themselves to 
  her as the storm had destroyed a tree, trapping her at these creatures mercy. These creatures were rumoured to be agressive, as such she surrendered any hope of escaping. They surpised her, by instead giving her aid and sheltering her under thier large wings.
  As for her report, it was never recieved, in fact the only reason this story was documented was the discovery of her private computer, which documented many creatures and events, all logs now classified by Orders 19 and B-3
  
</p>
<p>As of today, these legends is the only one remaining that is decipherable and not corrupted.</p>
